      %h2 Angelina Paz Calderon
      %p 
        Angelina grew up in Madison, WI in a large family where they spoke English and Spanish
        at home. Her childhood was largely spent at swim meets, practicing the violin and piano, learning the art of negotiation that comes from being the eldest of 3 sisters, and reading lots of books.
      %p 
        She attended Oberlin College where she was a member of the swim team (go OC, go OC, go!), and graduated
        from Luther College with majors in Music and Political Science. She earned her Master's degree in Vocal Pedagogy from New England Conservatory, where she partnered with Boston Lyric Opera to conduct the children's chorus.
      %p 
        After grad school, Angelina continued to sing in the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, Boston Cecilia and taught part-time at several Boston area private schools. She also started to grow a small design business in Boston, and in 2012 moved to San Francisco. She currently helps tech startups hire engineers at The Sourcery and sings in the San Francisco Symphony Chorus. She still swims, and in summer 2013 completed her first Trans-Tahoe Relay (that's nearly 12 miles).

Not having enough of AmeriCorps quite yet, Ben then became Program Director of the Digital Arts Service Corps where he recruited, placed and supported more than 200 AmeriCorps*VISTA members across 25 states. Ben was also active in the community, serving on the board of the Organizers Collaborative (mission: "technology tools and training for progressive social change"), and being a founding director of the Boston Cyclists Union

        In 2012, Ben moved to San Francisco and began doing technology stuff full-time. First compeleting a fellowship with Code for America, then working at OkCupid Labs, and currently now at Pantheon.

      %p
        Angelina and Ben met at the birthday party of a mutual friend (thanks Adriana!) in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. After dating for 2 years, they moved in together, and 2 years after that, they moved to San Francisco. On February 3, 2013, at picturesque Lake Tahoe, Ben proposed marriage to Angelina. She accepted.
