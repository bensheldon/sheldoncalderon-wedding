            <h2>Wedding Ceremony and Reception Facts</h2>
            <p><strong>Attire is "semi formal"</strong>. While Ben will be in a tuxedo and Angelina in a very fancy dress, the wedding party will be wearing suits and cocktail dresses.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Spring weather</strong> in San Francisco is around 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit with sporadic rain or fog. Wear layers and carry a jacket &#8211; warm sunny days fast turn into chilly nights!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Children are very much allowed</strong> and are encouraged to attend all wedding events!</p>
            
            <p><strong>All wedding venues are accessible.</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>We're working with our caterers to accomodate dietary restrictions.</strong> Please list any restrictions or allergies on your response card.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Leave your car at home!</strong> Both the ceremony and reception are on public transit lines. Taxi fare is also $5-$15 between locations in downtown San Francisco.</p>
            
            <p>The <strong>greatest gift you can give us is the opportunity to celebrate with you from wherever you are</strong> as we start our married life together.</p>

            <h2>Angelina Paz Calderon</h2>
            <p>
              Angelina grew up in Madison, WI in a large family where they spoke English and Spanish
              at home. Her childhood was largely spent at swim meets, practicing the violin and piano, learning the art of negotiation that comes from being the eldest of 3 sisters, and reading lots of books.
            </p>
            <p>
              She attended Oberlin College where she was a member of the swim team (go OC, go OC, go!), and graduated
              from Luther College with majors in Music and Political Science. She earned her Master's degree in Vocal Pedagogy from New England Conservatory, where she partnered with Boston Lyric Opera to conduct the children's chorus.
            </p>
            <p>
              After grad school, Angelina continued to sing in the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, Boston Cecilia and taught part-time at several Boston area private schools. She also started to grow a small design business in Boston, and in 2011 moved to San Francisco. She currently helps tech startups hire engineers at The Sourcery and sings in the San Francisco Symphony Chorus. She still swims, and in summer 2013 completed her first Trans-Tahoe Relay (that's nearly 12 miles).

Ben attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he received a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, graduating in three years.

              After college, Ben moved to Boston, where he served 3 years in AmeriCorps*VISTA: first as a youth-literacy fundraiser, then at a Cable Access TV station, and finally as a VISTA Leader where he supported other service members. Not having enough of AmeriCorps quite yet, Ben then became Program Director of the Digital Arts Service Corps where he recruited, placed and supported more than 200 AmeriCorps*VISTA members across 25 states. Ben was also active in the community, serving on the board of the Organizers Collaborative (mission: "technology tools and training for progressive social change"), and being a founding director of the Boston Cyclists Union
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2011, Ben moved to San Francisco and began doing technology stuff full-time. First compeleting a fellowship with Code for America, then working at OkCupid Labs, and currently now at Pantheon.

After dating for 2 years, they moved in together, and 2 years after that, they moved to San Francisco. On February 3, 2013, at picturesque Lake Tahoe, Ben proposed marriage to Angelina. She accepted.
